# SM-osu-theme
This is the worst idea I've ever had

# What is it
It's a StepMania theme that uses osu themes. Drop a theme into a folder named _skin in Graphics.
You also need some default graphics in case your theme is missing them... I can't help you get those, but put them in a folder named _fallback in Graphics.
